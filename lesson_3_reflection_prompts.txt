When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When other people work on it, or if I use different pc
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because other people could work on GitHub but I don't want the work on my local
