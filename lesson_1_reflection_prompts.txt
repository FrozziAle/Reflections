What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: less commit to check, in the right moment (when I make changes)
    cons: I must remember to save every time I end a task

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because I can make changes that involve more files whit the same goal

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is for view the commit's list, git diff is for compare two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can easly go back, I can be more risky

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    be more daredevil and bold whit my jobs
